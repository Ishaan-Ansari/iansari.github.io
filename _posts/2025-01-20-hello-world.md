## A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented and Cache-Augmented Generation


The AI space is abuzz with discussions around Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG). Let‚Äôs break down the differences between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and this newer approach, and explore their unique strengths and challenges.

### RAG in Action
The steps for implementing naive RAG: \\
1Ô∏è‚É£ Embed the user query for contextual search via vector databases‚Äîor skip this step if no contextual search is needed. \\
2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve relevant context from the database or another source. \\
3Ô∏è‚É£ Combine the user query with a system prompt for answer generation.\\
4Ô∏è‚É£ Enrich the prompt with the retrieved context. \\
5Ô∏è‚É£ Generate and deliver the final answer to the user.

### CAG Simplified
Here‚Äôs how CAG operates: \\
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-compute external context into a key-value (KV) cache for the LLM, storing it in memory. This step is one-and-done! \\
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a system prompt that guides the LLM on leveraging the cached context to generate a response. \\
3Ô∏è‚É£ Return the generated answer. Afterward, clear temporary generations but keep the original cached context for subsequent queries.

### Thoughts on CAG
‚û°Ô∏è Not entirely new: While described in a recent white paper, variations of CAG have been around since OpenAI and Anthropic introduced prompt caching. \\
‚ùå Accuracy concerns: LLMs still struggle with accuracy when handling very long contexts. \\ 
‚ùå Security challenges: CAG‚Äôs inability to isolate data makes it risky for enterprise use. \\ 
‚ùå Dynamic data limitations: Constantly changing data requires frequent recomputation of the KV cache. \\
‚úÖ Strengths in static scenarios: CAG shines when working with static, non-sensitive data. \\ 
‚úÖ Power of hybrid models: Combining RAG and CAG unlocks exciting possibilities‚Äîstay tuned for more insights on  this!
